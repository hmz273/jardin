The breakfast was varied with the traditional recipes, I loved the Moroccan tea, it's an addiction . We also had a spa day with a very professional spa therapist. Thanks to karima who make me feel like a princess. We had a lovely dinner with a romantic set up for the valentine's . We will definitely coming back. Thanks a lot "

      "text": "Not really what we would consider a 5 star by UK, US and Caribbean standards. They do try to be helpful and are polite, although NO all inclusive here, and the best you can expect is Half Board, rubbish really. The half board is breakfast and evening meal only and NO drinks. You can't swap lunch for evening meal you just get charged, we did. So if your out or don't fancy the same menu again it's tough. The menu is very limited especially for a 5 star which makes meal times boring, same little uninteresting eating area and small menu every day is quite tedious. The rooms we had a premium room with pool is worn and tired with lots of little bits of general maintenance required and the same goes for the hotel and the spa (staff in spa texting whilst giving massages, not great!) However the staff are polite and try to be helpful the shuttle service is OK but limited by the set times you can use it. We wouldn't go here again better hotels are in Marrakech just not available via Tui who are rubbish"

Three lovely pools one heated with lots of sun beds and room to enjoy the winter sun.<br><br>Top staff who can not do enough for you. The free shuttle is a great way of travelling in and out of the city.<br><br>Highly recommended we will be going back."
